				<p>Formerly a stray cat, Melissa has recently found a nice warm home. This doesn't prevent her from poking around corners and looking for new experiences though. She is an endlessly curious cat after all. And her indoor-outdoor-cat status doesn't stop her from being a wanderlust-stricken little being. And she wonders to herself, "what do the fish taste like in Crete?", and, "what could a kitty like me get up to in the south of France?", and, "what kind of cats live along the Trans-Siberian railway?". She knows she'll get there one day. The odds may be against her, but she doesn't really know about odds, so it doesn't matter.</p>
				<p>In the meantime, she's spending her time helping people make websites, learning how to meow in as many different languages as possible, photographing things, eating everything in sight, and doing some voiceovers. She also loves playing games and being pet.</p>
